Unfortunately this script uses java's comm library which is a major pain in the bum.  Sorry for that.

Dependencies:
1. Java JDK: http://java.sun.com/
2. Java Comm library: http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/
3. jRuby: http://jruby.codehaus.org/
4. Cruise Control: http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/index.html

Installation:
1. Copy the x10_controller.rb file to your bin directory
2. copy x10.jar (from CC installation) to your bin directory
3. copy comm.jar to your bin directory
4. create a javax.comm.properties file in your bin directory
5. edit the x10_controller.rb file to point to your CC status page.
6. make sure your x10 transciever is plugged in and your build light is attached.
7. make sure your cm17A is plugged into your serial port.
8. turn on the light and run the script like this: jruby x10_controller.rb  The light should turn off.
9. if it works setup a cron task to have the script poll your build every minute.  Here is a sample cron entry: * * * * * export JAVA_HOME=/opt/bea91/jrockit90_150_04; cd /home/pair/bin; /home/pair/bin/jruby x10_controller.rb
